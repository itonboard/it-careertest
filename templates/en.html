        <h3 id="he">Hardware Development</h3>
        <p>Hardware developers are responsible for the development of devices. The term hardware includes everything that belongs to the technical equipment of a system, such as computer parts, modems, or USB sticks. A distinction is made between installed and uninstalled hardware components: Internal hardware are, for example, the components of a smartphone, whereas mouse and keyboard are external devices. Simply put, everything you can touch is hardware, while software includes all non-physical components.</p>
        <p>To work as a hardware developer, you need a university degree, for example in electrical engineering or natural sciences.</p>
        <p class="nmbe">No degree programme is aimed solely at hardware development, so you should always take a lot of basic knowledge in the field of IT with you and start early with further training in hardware. During your studies, you can specialize in telematics, hardware-software design or network and communication technology, for example. In addition to training and practical knowledge, you should bring the following with you:</p>
        <ul class="circle">
            <li>deep technical understanding and very good IT skills</li>
            <li>confident handling of programming languages, operating systems, circuit design</li>
            <li>very good knowledge of English</li>
            <li>high quality awareness</li>
            <li>independent, self-reliant way of working</li>
            <li>ability to work in a team</li>
            <li>Flexibility and organizational skills</li>
        </ul>


        <h3 id="ha">Hardware Administration</h3>

        <p>
            The main task of the hardware or system administrator is to manage and maintain the IT infrastructure. Compared to a technician, however, they do not lay cables or are responsible for setting up hardware, but they are almost exclusively concerned with ensuring that, for example, the devices communicate smoothly with each other or that user rights are distributed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tasks of an administrator within an IT landscape can be versatile or limited to a specific subject area. Whether the administrator is an all-rounder or a specialist for one area often depends on the size of an IT landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
            A system administrator, for example, is responsible for managing the IT system. They make sure that access rights are correctly distributed, manages central storage or databases and has to make sure that the software is up to date or that new tools are installed. Network administrators manage email accounts, for example, and ensure that there is an internet connection, and are also responsible for ensuring that devices communicate with each other without problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            The server administrator, on the other hand, is responsible for the operation of servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            System or sever administrator, specialists as well as allrounders must have basic knowledge. In any case, an administrator must have sound knowledge in the area of operating systems. The necessary language skills are often underestimated. Every administrator should at least have a technical
            vocabulary in English, since not only are many commands in this language, but support from the
            manufacturer, for example, is often offered exclusively in English.

        <h3 id="se">Software Development</h3>

        <p>
            People working in software development are also called backend developers. Backend developers develop systems, add enhancements and maintain existing systems and applications. In development and maintenance, they deal with the part of an application that runs in the background, i.e. is invisible to the user. The backend is often about processing data that is sent to the frontend.
        </p>

        <p>
            The tasks of a backend developer include, for example:
        </p>
        <p>
            Analyzing requirements, developing, designing, implementing and maintaining a system or application; implementing and programming systems and applications; testing systems and programs; conducting customer meetings.
        </p>

        <p>
            Backend developers need hard skills in the following areas, for example:
        </p>
        <p>
            Good HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript skills; at least one programming language, e.g. PHP, Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Python, Java, C/C++; good handling of relational databases and SQL; English skills.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition, you need skills such as the ability to work in a team, creativity, organizational skills and analytical thinking.
        </p>


        <h3 id="ge">Creative area in IT: Development & Design</h3>

        <p>
            In the creative field in IT, we often speak of frontend developers and frontend designers
        </p>

        <p>
            The job title frontend developer is derived from the technical term "front end", which refers to the user interface of web-based applications. The frontend is therefore the part of an IT system that is closer to the user. Accordingly, the frontend developer as a programmer is primarily entrusted with developing web applications and constantly optimizing the code used for this purpose. The focus is on enhancing the user experience with a website.
        </p>

        <p>
            Frontend designers or web designers create and optimize websites. They design websites and implement the client's desired "corporate design" both creatively and technically, so that the client or their company is represented realistically on the Internet. The creation of animations, graphics, and layouts as well as the menu structure, chat function and voice control are among the tasks a web designer must fulfil. Other activities of a web designer include:
        </p>

        <p>
            Successful web designers as well as developers are communicative, approach new clients, and
            constantly educate themselves in the rapidly changing technical world.
            <br>
            In addition to a sound technical knowledge of website design and a creative streak, some soft skills in close customer contact are also an advantage.
        </p>

        <p>
            Foreign language skills are always an advantage. Especially in agencies that serve international clients, it may happen that consulting services are booked in English or other foreign languages.
        </p>
